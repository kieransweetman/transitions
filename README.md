# Number to word converter (eng -> FR)


Applying knowledge to a real word problem: building a simple web app for a Blog (annieandre.com) using existing libraries, implementing them
and applying refacotring principales. 

# Overview

For a project outside of The Odin Project, I wanted to implement what I learned to a real world business context: A simple number to word web app using an existing open source library. I used this library written by yamadapc (https://github.com/yamadapc/js-written-number) and modified it to fit the needs for this project.

The user picks a card that then tells the input what to dynamically add to the page. The DOM is updated in real time using an input event listener and adding the text content to the html structure. I used animations and style choices to help the web app fit the clients site style. 

**Currently still in developpement and this is a testing ground for the project.**
